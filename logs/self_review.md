[2025-05-19T22:08:59.927519] In addition to the main loop, modules like `thinker.py`, `editor.py`, and `functions.py` need to be implemented. The `function_executor.py` module handles calling and executing actionable items suggested by the model, which ensures that the system is responsive and can handle complex tasks.

To ensure continuous improvement, modules like `loop.py`, `tasks.md`, and `cron.md` need to be updated as needed. Human input can be recorded in the `self_review.md` file and reviewed regularly.

The deployment plan should outline the structured deployment methodology for the autonomous life assistant agent, including how to implement a main loop, integrate LLM reasoning, set up markdown file editor, add function execution logic, test human override mechanisms, document all modules, and reflect on priorities. Finally, the project is completed by integrating the LLM reasoning, setting up markdown file editor, adding function execution logic, and testing human override mechanisms to ensure robustness, transparency, and improvability.
[2025-05-19T22:12:25.976849] To ensure robust, transparent, and improvable autonomous operation of the life assistant agent, the deployment plan outlines the following steps:

1. Initialization
- Load all required files: `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `cron.md`, `human_input.md`, `memory.json`, `deployment_plan.md`.
- Initialize memory and logs if not present.

2. Main Loop
- At each cycle, the agent must:
  1. Read and interpret `deployment_plan.md` as a reference for its own operation.
  2. Read `plan.md` for project goals and structure.
  3. Read `tasks.md` and `cron.md` for actionable items and routine actions.
  4. Check `human_input.md` for override, redirection, or pause orders.
  5. Use `memory.json` to persist and recall knowledge.
  6. Use `thinker.py` to reason and generate next actions.
  7. Use `functions.py` and `function_executor.py` to execute structured actions.
  8. Use `editor.py` to modify markdown files as needed.
  9. Log all changes to `change_log.md`.
  10. Reflect and log thoughts in `self_review.md`.

3. Human Interaction
- If `human_input.md` is updated, prioritize its instructions.
- Allow human to override or redirect from `HOLD` to `PROP` status.
- Use the newly opened dialogue as a guide for changes to the deployment plan and the other modules.

4. Self-Reflection and Logging
- After each cycle, write a self-review to `self_review.md`.
- Log all file modifications to `change_log.md` with timesaustamps and reasons.

5. Continuous Improvement
- The agent should propose improvements to its own logic and files, updating `plan.md`, `deployment_plan.md`, and other modules as needed.

6. Error Handling
- On error, log to `change_log.md` and attempt recovery in the next cycle.

- Daily: Review and prioritize tasks for next week
- Weekly: Update self-review.md with new ideas and additions
- Monthly: Plan for upcoming improvements and make progress reports

To schedule or modify cron jobs, use the "edit_cron" action. A JSON list of actions can be output by executing this command:

```bash
$ ./bin/assistant run "actions:" {"type": "update_cron", "args": {}}
```

Additionally, you can update the task's priority and recurring status (if applicable) by adding a JSON object with those changes to your action:

```json
[
   {
     "type": "edit_markdown",
     "args": {
       "file": "src/tasks.md",
       "content": "# Tasks\n\n- [x] Complete task\n- [ ] New task to work on\n"
     }
   },

     "args": {
       "cron": {"job": "myTaskName@daily", "priority": 10, "recurring": false},
       "last_task_completed": "Initial setup"
     }
   }
]
```

As an autonomous agent, you should continue to prioritize and prioritize tasks according to their importance, ensure that tasks are completed within the specified deadlines, and schedule recurring tasks accordingly. You can also use additional actions such as "search_web" to search for information online or "remind" to create a reminder for future appointments.
