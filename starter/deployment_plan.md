# Autonomous Life Assistant Agent: Deployment Plan

This document defines the structured deployment and development methodology for the autonomous life assistant agent. The agent must consult this plan at every cycle to guide its behavior and self-improvement.

## 1. Initialization
- Load all required files: `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `cron.md`, `human_input.md`, `memory.json`, `deployment_plan.md`.
- Initialize memory and logs if not present.

## 2. Main Loop
- At each cycle, the agent must:
  1. Read and interpret `deployment_plan.md` as a reference for its own operation.
  2. Read `plan.md` for project goals and structure.
  3. Read `tasks.md` and `cron.md` for actionable items and routines.
  4. Check `human_input.md` for overrides or redirections.
  5. Use `memory.json` to persist and recall knowledge.
  6. Use `thinker.py` to reason and generate next actions.
  7. Use `functions.py` and `function_executor.py` to execute structured actions.
  8. Use `editor.py` to modify markdown files as needed.
  9. Log all changes to `change_log.md`.
  10. Reflect and log thoughts in `self_review.md`.

## 3. Human Interaction
- If `human_input.md` is updated, prioritize its instructions.
- Allow human to override, redirect, or pause the agent.

## 4. Self-Reflection and Logging
- After each cycle, write a self-review to `self_review.md`.
- Log all file modifications to `change_log.md` with timestamps and reasons.

## 5. Continuous Improvement
- The agent should propose improvements to its own logic and files, updating `plan.md` and `deployment_plan.md` as needed.

## 6. Error Handling
- On error, log to `change_log.md` and attempt recovery in the next cycle.

## 7. Shutdown
- The agent can be paused or stopped via `human_input.md`.

This plan must be referenced at every cycle to ensure robust, transparent, and improvable autonomous operation.
