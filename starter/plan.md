# Project Plan: Autonomous Life Assistant Agent

## Project Goal
To create an autonomous agent that continuously assists the user in achieving their goals by reasoning, planning, and executing actions, while remaining improvable and transparent.

## Modular Structure
- **loop.py**: Main execution loop, orchestrates all modules.
- **thinker.py**: Handles LLM prompts and interprets responses.
- **editor.py**: Reads and modifies markdown files.
- **functions.py**: Defines callable functions (reminders, web search, etc.).
- **function_executor.py**: Executes actions suggested by the model.
- **utils.py**: Helper utilities for file I/O and formatting.

## Key Files

- `tasks.md`: List of current tasks.
- `cron.md`: Scheduled routines.
- `human_input.md`: Human overrides and redirections.
- `memory.json`: Persistent agent memory.
- `deployment_plan.md`: Step-by-step deployment and development methodology.
- `change_log.md`: Log of all file modifications.
- `self_review.md`: Agent's self-reflection after each cycle.

## Success Criteria
- Agent reliably loops, reasons, and acts.
- Human can override or redirect at any time.
- All changes and reflections are logged.
- Agent can improve its own logic and plans.
